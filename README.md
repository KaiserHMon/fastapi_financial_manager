## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11+
*   Poetry for dependency management
*   Redis

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-financial-manager.git
    cd api-financial-manager
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies using Poetry:

    ```


### Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and other environment variables:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=yourdatabase_url_here
    ASYNC_DATABASE_URL=your_async_database_url_here
    # Example: DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/dbname
    # Example: ASYNC_DATABASE_URL=mysql+aiomysql://user:password@localhost/dbname


    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
    JWT_ALGORITHM=your_jwt_algorithm_here
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=your_access_token_expire_minutes_here
    REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=your_refresh_token_expire_minutes_here


    EXCHANGE_API_KEY=tu_api_key_de_monedas

    REDIS_URL=your_redis_port
    ```

### Running the application

1.  Apply the database migrations:
    ```bash
    poetry run alembic upgrade head
    ```
2.  Start the application:
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --reload
    ```

## Caching

This application uses Redis for caching to improve performance. The following endpoints are cached:

*   `GET /categories/`
*   `GET /categories/{category_id}`
*   `GET /incomes/`
*   `GET /incomes/{income_id}`
*   `GET /expenses/`
*   `GET /expenses/{expense_id}`
*   `GET /user/balance`
*   `GET /user/balance/incomes`
*   `GET /user/balance/expenses`

The cache expires after 1 hour (3600 seconds). When new data is created, updated, or deleted, the cache is not automatically invalidated. To clear the cache, you need to restart the application.

---

## üß™ Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

---

## üìñ API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available:

*   `/auth`: Authentication (login, refresh token, logout)
*   `/users`: User management (create, read, update, delete)
*   `/categories`: Category management
*   `/incomes`: Income management
*   `/expenses`: Expense management
*   `/user_balance`: User balance (total, incomes and expenses)

For more details on each endpoint, you can access the interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the application is running.
